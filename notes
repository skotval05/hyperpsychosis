Hi there! just gonna put some things down, will organize as I go further.

                                FOREWORD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperpsychosis is a game about burnt stimuli. As you cling to your remaining senses,
you feel them distort and adapt. During a particularly intense episode, you feel something
living in your forearm. In an attempt to remove this parasite, you slice your own arm open to the bone,
and find amongst the twitching muscle mass and lacerated flesh an Eye staring right back at you.

The Eye sees you.
The Eye knows you.

You can not bring yourself to remove the Eye. You run to find your first aid kit to sew your arm back up.
The wound is closed, but the Eye is still there. You both know this. Flashes of light and darkness flood your view.
Your wounded arm acts on its own.

The Eye whispers to you.
The Eye shows you TRUTH.

The remainder of the laced psychedelics you just bought are in your mouth before you have time to act. The Eye grows louder.
You stare into the mirror, at your own being apparently twisting and contorting before you.

This is your last trip. As the mirror swallows you whole, your vision fades into darkness and into blinding light simultaneously.
Your view is enhanced, yet destroyed. Your reflections move on their own. You know in your gut this isn't real, but you can't
afford the liberty of that assumption. They see you. They know.

The Eye will guide us.
The Eye will protect us.

                           TECHNICAL NEEDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperpsychosis should have a multiplayer mode first. I am not sure how much I really think a campaign or arena singleplayer
mode is necessary or how much it fits with the theme of the game. If I were going to incorporate this it would be very
reminiscent of HYPER DEMON's singleplayer mode. I'm not sure how much I can take from that and turn into something of my own.
I think this game is, first and foremost, a multiplayer arena shooter.

I know I want some batshit insane visuals. Unreasonably high spherical FOV, massive flashing text in the spirit of POST VOID.
What is it with wild indie shooters being all caps? idk. anyway. 

We should incorporate non-euclidian geometry, that could be super cool to be sprinting through at insane speed and getting lost
within. Not totally set on it, but could be sweet.

Gonna need the ability to overlay solid color backgrounds with text on it and change color rapidly.
